1. A node is randomly given an attribute X
2. A node is given a probability which is a function of difference of X [p(dX)]. p(dX) will be either power-law, or any decreasing function, which reflects that human tends to bond with those who have similar attribute.
3. You have two control parameters, (i) the standard deviation of X, and (ii) the standard deviation of the probability distribution p(dX).
4. There exists a dynamical process, which is like a threshold-update model. So, nodes change their attribute, through interaction with other nodes.
5. Observe (i) what kind of nodes (node with what standard deviation) become the center of all connection, and
(ii) degree of homophily
(iii) clustering coefficient.



in real world representation:
X means personal attribute (environmental, genetic condition), and p(X) means how flexible an individual is (individual action).
