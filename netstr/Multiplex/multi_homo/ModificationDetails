NEM (network evolution model) + Homophily

1. Link deletion
 delete edges that links different state nodes (1-0, 0-1).

2. Rewiring
 rewire edges such a way that connects nodes with the same state (1-1, 0-0).








Mixture of baseline homophily / inbreeding homophily
: baseline homophily: state homophily
  inbreeding homophily: threshold homophily

Or, add 'geographical coordination' as a default, and add threshold attribute / state attribute. Geographical attribute doesn't change, and state attribute changes by cascade, and threshold update changes by averaging process. Then,

1. communty by similar threshold values will emerge initially

edge probability between nodes with the same state increases, if they're within the radius of influence. then,

2.1. subcommunities of the same state will emerge.
2.2. subcommunity of state-1 nodes will emerge, and be separate from original commmunity, and merge with state-1 community from distant state-1 subcommunities.

=> still, HOW TO SET EDGE PROBABILITY BETWEEN SAME STATE NODES IS UNCLEAR.
