Nodes with the similar threshold form edges with higher probability.
This is to mimic the IMPORTANCE OF NODAL ATTRIBUTE in human relationship.

Or like an adaptive network, where edges keep changing, initially start with erdos renyi network (random edge formation which mimics initial meeting between many people), and then develops into a homophilous network by rewiring edges based on similar threshold.



Basic assumption: EVERYONE HAS DIFFERENT PERSONALITY.

THE DIFFERENCE WITH BOGUNA'S MODEL:

in boguna's model, you can artificially give a degree of homophily $\alpha$, and change the size of macro-scopic homophily (homophily of a whole network).
however, in our model, homophily is different AS A WHOLE, and also AS SEPARATE SMALL GROUPS. In Boguna's model, we need two parameters: threshold distribution parameteres (mean, std of distribution) and $\alpha$, while in our model, we only need one parameter, which is about threshold distribution. (We don't need to control $\alpha$, as it's a parameter that is naturally determined by different threshold distribution parameter. Therefore, Clustering and Homophily appears 'naturally', than 'artificially controlling $\alpha$'. $\alpha$ is a function dependent on time t and degree distribution's mean and std.

n order to do so, our model consists of two important mechanisms, which are:

(i) COMMUNITY DETECTION ALGORITHM is conducted at every time steps, and
(ii) An algorithm quantifying the degree of homophily is run for each communities, and decides each community's $\alpha$, at every time step.

I wish this could make a network model to have (i) homophily, and (ii) high clustering coefficient NATURALLY.
