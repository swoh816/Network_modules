Nodes with the similar threshold form edges with higher probability.
This is to mimic the IMPORTANCE OF NODAL ATTRIBUTE in human relationship.

Or like an adaptive network, where edges keep changing, initially start with erdos renyi network (random edge formation which mimics initial meeting between many people), and then develops into a homophilous network by rewiring edges based on similar threshold.
