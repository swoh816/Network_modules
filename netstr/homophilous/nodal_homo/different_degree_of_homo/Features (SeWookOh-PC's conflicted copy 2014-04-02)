Nodes with the similar threshold form edges with higher probability.
This is to mimic the IMPORTANCE OF NODAL ATTRIBUTE in human relationship.

Or like an adaptive network, where edges keep changing, initially start with erdos renyi network (random edge formation which mimics initial meeting between many people), and then develops into a homophilous network by rewiring edges based on similar threshold.



THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WITH BOGUNA'S MODEL

in boguna's model, you can artificially give a degree of homophily $\alpha$.
however, in our model, 

(i) COMMUNITY DETECTION ALGORITHM is conducted at every time steps, and
(ii) An algorithm quantifying the degree of homophily is run for each communities, and decides each community's $\alpha$.

I wish this could make a network model to have (i) homophily, and (ii) high clustering coefficient NATURALLY.
