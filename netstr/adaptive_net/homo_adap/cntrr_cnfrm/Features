<Contrarian vs Conformer>

The fundamental difference between contrarian and conformer is 'the degree of the sense of belonging.' conformers want to be in a group, so they don't go against other people. However, contrarians don't want to be in a group, so they try to go against other people for the sake of being different from others. Conformers have strong homophily, while contrarians have strong heterophily.


There is a homophily to form bond with similar others. It's human nature, also, that we all have tendency to form group.

The degree to which we feel safe in a group -- the degree to form a group differ by different individuals

Using above two characteristics, we can make a model with

i) membership index
ii) homophily based on the degree of membership index






The group dynamics naturally shows cascade. There is a cascade in a sense that the transition from

modular net -> single net -> moudlar net -> single net

and that kind of network structural change is kind of a cascade of information, in a sense that 'each individual changes its connection based on its information (modularity, membership) and its nature to get together with similar others (homophily). Therefore, the sudden change of network structure (or shape) is also a cascade.





If this research goes successfully (as my prediction above), following sentences will be written on my paper:

One of the theories in anthropology insists that human could form a concept of a group when our brain size was ballooned during the evolution period, when we were homo sapiens.  Since then we could apply the motivations and emotions originally associated with actual groups to the conceptual group. In fact, our interest in group dynamics has drived us to do in-depth research.

According to the above literature, it says:
These new cognitive abilities enabled humans to form larger groups without a loss of groupness.
The size of the group was now, in effect, unlimited, because its members didn't have to be personally acquainted with one another.

However, as we showed in our study, under certain condition, there IS a limit to which our group can grow. Also, the groupness -- if it means modularity in the literature -- decreases with the decrease of modularity.
