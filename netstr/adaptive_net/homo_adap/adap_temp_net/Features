Nodes with the similar time stamps (in the temporal network) form edges with higher probability.
This is to mimic the IMPORTANCE OF TIMING in human relationship.

Or like an adaptive network, where edges keep changing, initially start with erdos renyi network (random edge formation which mimics initial meeting between many people), and then develops into a homophilous network by rewiring edges based on similar time stamps.
=> Adaptive temporal network is a temporal network that is adaptive. For example, a temporal network rewires their edges (adaptive) by their similarity in time stamp.
