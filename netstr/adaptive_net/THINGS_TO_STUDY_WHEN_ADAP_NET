(from Thilo Gross' "Adaptive coevolutionary networks: a review")

Things to check when study adaptive networks:
i) robust topological self-organization
ii) associated appearance of power laws
iii) Detailed investigation on the relationship between dynamics & topology
iv) relationship between local & global property


Important parameters of adaptive networks:
i) timescales of evolution of topology & state --- separate time scale? or happen at the same time?
