    """Return a random graph with the given degree sequence.

    The configuration model generates a random pseudograph (graph with
    parallel edges and self loops) by randomly assigning edges to
    match the given degree sequence.

    Parameters
    ----------
    deg_sequence :  list of integers
        Each list entry corresponds to the degree of a node.
    create_using : graph, optional (default MultiGraph)
       Return graph of this type. The instance will be cleared.
    seed : hashable object, optional
        Seed for random number generator.

    Returns
    -------
    G : MultiGraph
        A graph with the specified degree sequence.
        Nodes are labeled starting at 0 with an index
        corresponding to the position in deg_sequence.

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXError
        If the degree sequence does not have an even sum.

    --------
    is_valid_degree_sequence

    Notes
    -----
    As described by Newman [1]_.

    A non-graphical degree sequence (not realizable by some simple
    graph) is allowed since this function returns graphs with self
    loops and parallel edges.  An exception is raised if the degree
    sequence does not have an even sum.

    This configuration model construction process can lead to
    duplicate edges and loops.  You can remove the self-loops and
    parallel edges (see below) which will likely result in a graph
    that doesn't have the exact degree sequence specified.  This
    "finite-size effect" decreases as the size of the graph increases.
