People consider the importance of future exponentially less than current. ex) Now is the most important, tomorrow is less important, the day after tomorrow is even less important, ...

I wonder if this can be related to my dosage decrease function (either netdyn/loss_of_interest or netdyn/losing_influence). If one consider the importance of time t=1 as 100 and time t=2 as 50, then the information he received at time t=1 remains in his cognition as much as 100 while it decreases to 50 at time t=2. make sense?
